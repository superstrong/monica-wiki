Monica can be installed on a variety of platforms. The choice of the platform is yours.

## Requirements

Monica depends on the following:

* Git
* PHP 7.0+
* [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/)
* MySQL
* Optional: Redis or Beanstalk

The preferred OS distribution is Ubuntu 16.04, simply because all the development is made on it and we know it works. However, any OS that lets you install the above packages should work.
